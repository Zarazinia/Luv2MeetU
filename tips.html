    <h2>Conversation Tips</h2>

<p>
  Keep your conversation short but don’t give one word answers.
    </p>
<p>
Make sure you listen to the other person and ask them questions about what they’ve told you.
    </p>
<p>
Make sure your tone of voice is friendly.
    </p>
<p>
Don’t interrupt the other person, this can be seen as very rude!
    </p>
<p>
If conversation gets stuck use the questions to get it started again, they’ll be things to ask to break the ice or get the conversation flowing again.
    </p>
<p>
Make sure you let the other people/person speak.
    </p>
<p>
Another way to get a conversation started is to ask the other person to tell a story about something funny that’s happened to them or  trip abroad. If you are in a group you could all tell your own story, see who has the funniest, happiest or most scary!
    </p>
<p>
Be kind and thoughtful when hearing what others have to say. Don’t put some-one or their ideas down just because you don’t agree with them.
    </p>
    <p>
You can disagree with some-one and stay friendly!
    </p>
    
    <h2>Dating Tips</h2>

    <p>By smiling at your date, it shows that you are happy to be with them. If you are sat at a table together, it's good to face them to show that you are 
      interested in talking to them.</p>
    
    <p>You may want to give your date a hug when you first see them and they might want to hug you too. However, not everybody likes to be hugged on a first date.
      It might be a good idea to ask your date if they would like a hug before doing so, and if they say no, this is absolutely fine.</p>
    
    <p><img class="imgright" src="https://via.placeholder.com/100" alt="image placeholder">Ask your date <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="questions.html">questions</a></span> to get to know them, but also to make sure that you talk 
      about what your likes and dislikes are too, so that you can both get to know each other.</p>
    
    <p>Remember that if you don't think that you have romantic feelings for your date then this is absolutely fine. It is very normal to go on a first date but feel 
      like you don't want to have a relationship with this person. Many people go on lots of first dates before finding a relationship.</p>
