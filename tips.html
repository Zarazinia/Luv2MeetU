  <h1>Some dating tips to think about</h1>

    <p><img class="imgleft" src="https://via.placeholder.com/100" alt="image placeholder">By smiling at your date, it shows that you are happy to be with them. If you are sat at a table together, it's good to face them to show that you are 
      interested in talking to them.</p>
    
    <p>You may want to give your date a hug when you first see them and they might want to hug you too. However, not everybody likes to be hugged on a first date.
      It might be a good idea to ask your date if they would like a hug before doing so, and if they say no, this is absolutely fine.</p>
    
    <p><img class="imgright" src="https://via.placeholder.com/100" alt="image placeholder">Ask your date <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="questions.html">questions</a></span> to get to know them, but also to make sure that you talk 
      about what your likes and dislikes are too, so that you can both get to know each other.</p>
    
    <p>Remember that if you don't think that you have romantic feelings for your date then this is absolutely fine. It is very normal to go on a first date but feel 
      like you don't want to have a relationship with this person. Many people go on lots of first dates before finding a relationship.</p>
